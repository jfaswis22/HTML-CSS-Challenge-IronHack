                    <p>
                        Littering a dark and dreary road lay the past relics of browser-specific tags,
                        incompatible DOMs, broken CSS support, and abandoned browsers.<br><br>
                        We must clear the mind of the past. Web enlightenment has been achieved thanks
                        to the tireless efforts of folk like W3C, WaS, and the major browser creators.<br><br>
                        The CSS Zen Garden invites you to relax and meditate on the important lessons
                        of the masters. Begin to see with clarity. Learn to use the time-honored
                        techniques in new and invigorating fashion. Become one with the web.

                    <p>
                        There is a continuing need to show the power of CSS. The Zen Garden<br> aims to excite,
                        inspire, and encourage participation. To begin, view some<br> of the existing designs in the list.
                        Clicking on any one will load the style<br> sheet into this very page. The HTML remains the same,
                        the only thing that<br> has changed is the external CSS file. Yes, really.<br><br>
                        CSS allows complete and total control over the style of a hypertext<br> document.
                        The only way this can be illustrated in a way that gets people<br> excited is by demonstrating what
                        it
                        can truly be,
                        once the reins are placed<br> in the hands of those able to create beauty from structure.
                        Designers and<br> coders alike have contributed to the beauty of the web; we can always<br> push it
                        further.

                        Strong visual design has always been our focus. You are modifying this page,
                        so strong CSS skills are necessary too, but the example files are commented well
                        enough that even CSS novices can use them as starting points.
                        Please see the <a href="#">CSS Resource Guide</a> for advanced tutorials and tips on working
                        with
                        CSS.<br><br>
                        You may modify the style sheet in any way you wish, but not the HTML.
                        This may seem daunting at first if you've never worked this way before,
                        but follow the listed links to learn more, and use the sample files as a guide.<br><br>
                        Download the sample <a href="#">HTML</a> and <a href="#">CSS</a> to work on a copy locally.
                        Once you have completed your masterpiece (and please, don't submit half-finished work) upload
                        your
                        CSS file to a web server under your control. <a href="#">Send us a link</a> to an archive of
                        that
                        file and all associated assets,
                        and if we choose to use it we will download it and place it on our server.

                        people how amazing CSS really can be. This site serves<br> as equal parts inspiration for those 
                        working on the web today, learning<br> tool for those who will be tomorrow, and gallery of future 
                        techniques we<br> can all look forward to.
